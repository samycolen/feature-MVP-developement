**** User Authentication 
---> 
As a user,
I want to have a secure way to log in and access the platform,
So that my data and interactions are protected.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Users can register for a new account in our s/s.
- [ ] Users can log in with their credentials like email as ID and Password.
- [ ] Passwords are securely stored (hashed) in the database.
- [ ] Users can reset their password if forgotten.
- [ ] Sessions are secure and encrypted.
- [ ] Access to certain features is restricted to authenticated users.

**** Drag and Drop Interface : 
--->
for non coder, we will provide a drag and drop interfeace where they can interact 
w/t our s/s to implement the OpenAI services in their product

process -
- [ ] we ask the user to provide the code so our system can understand at the backend.
- [ ] our Model understand code and provide an interface accordingly where user can implement 
      the requirements.
- [ ] 


**** OpenAI API Integration:
--->
as a user, 
- [ ] Users can connect their OpenAI API key to the platform.or else our system will create one for them....it not decided yet 
- [ ] The system securely stores and manages OpenAI API keys.
- [ ] Users can select the OpenAI service they want to integrate : 
      1. GPT-4
      2. Assistant API
      3. TTS(Text to Speech)
      4. DALL-E3
      5. Whisper 
      6. other
- [ ] Users can input their specific requirements and instructions for the OpenAI service or it will be unerstand by our 
      Model when they provide there code.
- [ ] The system communicates effectively with OpenAI's API to generate responses or perform actions.
- [ ] Users can review and manage their usage of OpenAI's API services.
- [ ] The integration process is user-friendly and well-documented.
- [ ] Develop the backend logic to seamlessly integrate OpenAI's API based on user input.

 

**** Analytics Dashboard:
--->
   - Implement a dashboard for users to track usage analytics and performance metrics.


**** User Profiles:
    - Allow users to create and manage profiles with preferences and settings.

**** Documentation:
    - Provide comprehensive documentation to guide users on using the platform effectively.


**** Security Measures:
    - Incorporate security measures to protect user data and ensure a secure environment.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features:

- User Authentication
- Drag-and-Drop Interface

Stuff to remind : 

4. **Code Interpreter Tool:**
   - Implement a tool that translates snippets of code from one language to another.

5. **Knowledge Retrieval:
    - Create a feature that allows users to search and retrieve relevant information using OpenAI's API.

6. **Function Calling:
    - Enable users to build custom tools by invoking multiple functions at once.
